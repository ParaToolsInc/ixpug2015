In this example we simple profile the code 
with event base sampling 

mpirun.host -n 8 tau_exec -T icpc,papi,ompt,mpi,pdt,openmp -ebs ./matmult
pprof -e | less

and view the results [a list of profiles per rank]
using pprof. 


Look for names of subroutines and program blocks from matlmult.f90 in the results.
