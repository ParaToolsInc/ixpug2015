These examples are using a simple MPI parallelized matrix-matrix multiply code in Fortran.
These will all be executed on Xeon's of aquired node.

We will be using pprof to view results.  Paraprof can be explored later in the workshop.


DO:  source ../host_vars.sh (or.csh) 
  *This sets PATH and TAU_MAKEFILE and xeon papi

Example 1: Library interposition using tau_exec.

   Result: Profile of times

Example 2: Instrument the code with PDT.

   Result: Profiles of times
