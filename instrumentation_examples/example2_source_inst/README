In this example we simple profile the code 
with source based instrumentation using the PDT parser.

First do:
make

then run:

mpirun.host -n 8 ./matmult
pprof -e | less

and view the results [a list of profiles per rank]
using pprof. 


Look for names of subroutines and program blocks from matlmult.f90 in the results.
Note times.

Run pprof -f profile.<pick one> for particular rank profile.

To see how the code was instrumented do:

make clean
make -f Makefile.keepFiles
view matmult.inst.f90

Look for "TAU"
